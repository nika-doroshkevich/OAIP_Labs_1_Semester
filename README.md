# :pushpin: This is my labs in Delphi 7 for the subject "Fundamentals of Algorithmization and Programming (Part 1)"

I did these labs in the first year of university in the first semester.

## :white_check_mark: Lab 1
In this laboratory, it was necessary to calculate the values of the function for various n and x.

## :white_check_mark: Lab 2
In this laboratory, it was necessary to develop a program to find the greatest common divisor for two or more numbers.

## :white_check_mark: Lab 3
In this laboratory, it was necessary to calculate the values of the function for various x with a given accuracy.

## :white_check_mark: Lab 4
In this laboratory, it was necessary to calculate the length of the longest sawtooth sequence of consecutive numbers for a given array.

## :white_check_mark: Lab 5
In this laboratory, it was necessary to fill a square matrix with the numbers 1, 2, 3... in a spiral, starting from the upper right corner (clockwise).

## :white_check_mark: Lab 6
In this laboratory, it was necessary to arrange the elements of the matrix rows by non-decreasing, and the rows themselves by ascending minimum row elements.

## :white_check_mark: Lab 8
In this lab we worked with strings.

## :white_check_mark: Bacteria task
In this task, the red bacterium turned green in one clock cycle, and the green one was divided into two (red and green) in one clock cycle. It was necessary to calculate the sum of all bacteria for a certain number of cycles, as well as the number of red and green bacteria.

## :white_check_mark: Monks task
In this task, the number of monks and the number of pies were given. The number of pies the monks ate depended on their rank. It was necessary to calculate the number of monks of different ranks.
